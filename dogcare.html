            <p class="lead my-3">The Cane Corso ("Corso" for short), a large-sized, muscular Mastiff breed, is a
                devoted, intelligent protector of
                its people. These dogs are beloved by owners around the world--and if properly trained and cared for,
                Corsos can
                be docile, loving, and devoted members of active families.</p>

            </h3>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Corsos need exercise</h2>
                <p> Overall Cane Corso care and maintenance takes a moderate amount of work, and will need to include
                    early training and socialization and plenty of daily exercise.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Since these dogs are very athletic and muscular, Cane Corso exercise requirements are quite high.
                    These dogs will need physical activities that benefit them in several ways: first, they need
                    conditioning through walks, jogs, bike rides, or fetch; they'll also do well to have some mental
                    stimulation (canine sports, etc.); and those formidable Cane Corso muscles will need to be
                    maintained as well (tug-of-war, weight-pulling).</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The typical adult Corso, depending on its age and overall activity level, will need about 90
                        minutes of proper exercise per day. You can start exercising your Corso puppy when it's three
                        months old by taking it on short (5- to 10-minute) leashed walks, then you can increase the
                        walks' length and frequency as the puppy grows. And these early walks are a good opportunity to
                        start teaching the puppy obedience and discipline, through leash training: have the puppy walk
                        beside or behind you on the leash instead of being allowed to lead or "tug" on it. This, in the
                        puppy's mind, establishes you as the leader, and should make training easier as the pup matures.
                    </p>
                    <p>Exercise Ideas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Walking/Jogging/Bicycling</li>
                        <li>Fetch/Frisbee</li>
                        <li>Tug-of-War</li>
                        <li>Hiking</li>
                    </ul>
                </blockquote>
                <h2>Cane Corso Maintenance</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>In terms of shedding and drooling, these dogs need moderate to frequent care. Cane Corso shedding is
                    light for most of the year, but heavier during the twice-yearly shedding seasons; drooling is a bit
                    of an issue as well.</p>
                <p>Corsos have short-haired, glossy, double-layered coats that don't shed too much most of the time--but
                    when they blow their coats in the spring and fall, the shedding is profuse. Owners will need to
                    brush their Corsos weekly with a bristle brush to keep the shedding to a minimum, and hair
                    cleanup--vacuuming the floors and lint rollers on clothes and furniture--will be necessary
                    occasionally. (Brushing and cleanup will of course be required more often during shedding season.)
                </p>
                <h2>Cane Corso Diet</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>As with all breeds, the Cane Corso diet will need to include plenty of animal proteins and
                    carbohydrates for energy, vitamins and minerals for digestive and immune health, and omega fatty
                    acids for coat and skin wellness. This means the best Cane Corso dog food is the premium dry kind,
                    particularly the kind made for large breeds, as it contains balanced portions of the above-listed
                    ingredients. While some owners prefer to feed their Cane Corso a raw diet of fresh meats,
                    vegetables, and other protein sources, many find such a diet to be too expensive and time-consuming,
                    and choose premium dry food instead.
                </p>
                <h4>Recommendation</h4>
                <p>Though opinions differ on what's the best dog food for a Cane Corso, the most popular and convenient
                    choice is premium dry food, specifically the kind formulated for large breeds. This food type,
                    though more expensive and difficult to obtain, will provide your Corso with the nutrients it needs
                    to maintain its health in the long term.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the most popular brand for this breed is Bully Max. Cane Corso dogs also do well with Royal
                    Canin, Blue Buffalo, and Taste of the Wild.</p>
